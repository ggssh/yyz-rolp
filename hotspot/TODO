NoGC timeline

Tasks:
1 - allow objects of specific classes to be allocated in the old generation.
Each thread should have another TLAB so that independent allocation into old
generation is guaranteed.

2 - find an alternative for having arbitrary objects allocated into the old
generation: a) extend the new operator, b) set environment variables, c) other
options?

3 - experiment and measure performance improvements with: a) cassandra,
b) spark/storm. Find and explore other potential sources of performance
overhead.

Deadlines:
1 - Jan 1  2016
2 - Fev 1  2016
3 - Fev 15 2016
